Primary, Mobile and Footer.  \r\n \r\n* **Primary** is for the Main site navigation, it's unavailable on mobile devices.   \r\n* **Mobile** is for Responsive Mobile Menu, shown on mobile devices, instead of Primary. You may want to create another menu for Mobile location, or you can add the same one you added in the Primary location.   \r\n* **Footer** location is placed in the right footer. You can use it as a regular menu or as a Social Links menu. If you add custom links to your social networks, the menu items will be presented with coresponding icon (isons are provided by Ionicons icon font). Textual part of the link will be visually hidden, but still available for screen readers.  \r\n\r\n### Base Settings\r\n- **Base Typography** - Font Family, text and links color. **Default Font Family is Roboto**\r\n- **Typography Size - Modular Scale** - A modular scale is a sequence of numbers that relate to one another in a meaningful way.
